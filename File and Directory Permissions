*File Permission:
 The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system.
 The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions,

 The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions, which have been described below −

 *Read
  Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.

 *Write
  Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.

 *Execute
  User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.

*Directory Permission:
  Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file.
  There are a few differences that need to be mentioned −

  *Read
   Access to a directory means that the user can read the contents. The user can look at the filenames inside the directory.

  *Write
   Access means that the user can add or delete files from the directory.

   *Execute
    Executing a directory doesn't really make sense, so think of this as a traverse permission.

   A user must have execute access to the bin directory in order to execute the ls or the cd command.
