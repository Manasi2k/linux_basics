 Accessing Files:
1. File ownership is an important component of Unix that provides a secure method for storing files. 
2. Every file in Unix has the following attributes −
 *Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
 *Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, 
                     who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
 *Other (world) permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.
