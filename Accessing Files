 Accessing Files:
1. File ownership is an important component of Unix that provides a secure method for storing files. 
2. Every file in Unix has the following attributes −
 *Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
 *Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, 
                     who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
 *Other (world) permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

3.File Access Modes:
 The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system.
 The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions,
 which have been described below −The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system. 
 The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions, which have been described below −

 *Read
  Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.

 *Write
  Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.

 *Execute
  User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.

4.Directory Access Modes
  Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file.
  There are a few differences that need to be mentioned −

  *Read
   Access to a directory means that the user can read the contents. The user can look at the filenames inside the directory.

  *Write
   Access means that the user can add or delete files from the directory.

   *Execute
    Executing a directory doesn't really make sense, so think of this as a traverse permission.

   A user must have execute access to the bin directory in order to execute the ls or the cd command.
